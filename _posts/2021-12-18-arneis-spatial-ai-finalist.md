This morning I found an email in my inbox which I have been hoping for a long time:

> Da: OpenCV Competition <competition@opencv.org><br>
> Date: ven 17 dic 2021 alle ore 18:32<br>
> Subject: Your Team Is An OpenCV Spatial AI Contest Finalist!<br>
> To: Gianpaolo <gmacario@gmail.com>
>
> Hello Gianpaolo,
>
> Congratulations.
> Your team “B-AROL-O Bottling Systems” and project “ARNEIS: Automated Recognizer, Network-Enabled, Items Sorter” have been selected as one of just 50 teams to move on to Phase 2 of OpenCV Spatial AI Contest.
> Your team name and region are listed on the official webpage at <https://opencv.org/opencv-spatial-ai-contest/​>
>
> Thanks to the generosity of our sponsors Intel and Microsoft Azure, and hardware partner Luxonis, as a finalist your team will receive:
>
> * 500 hours of Microsoft Azure training on Intel's D32ds v4 hardware
> * Up to 3 OpenCV AI Kit (OAK-D-LITE) Devices
> * Up to $400 in LEGO bricks to build your project
> * Access to Intel® DevCloud

Wow! At the end the proposal we submitted a few weeks ago was selected and now we are one of the 50 finalist teams of the [OpenCV Spatial AI Competition](https://opencv.org/opencv-spatial-ai-contest/​)!

## What's next?

Now we have to fill in the forms to be entitled to receive the materials which will allow us to progress in the next phase of the Contest.

I made a resolution for 2022 that I will be blogging our progress with the ARNEIS project until the end of Phase 2. Please comment and support us to make this resolution come true!
