This post explains how to use Open Source tools for capturing Bluetooth Low Energy packets on a remote Linux host and display them in real-time on [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/).

## Before you begin

To follow the directions in this guide, youâ€™ll need the following:

- A Linux host (acting as BLE packet capturing device) with the following characteristics:
  - OS: a recent Debian or Ubuntu distribution
  - SSH server installed
  - Package `bluez-utils` installed
  - A Bluetooth Low Energy adapter supported by the Linux host
- [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) installed either on the Linux host or on another machine (in this case the OS may also be Windows or macOS)

Those instructions were tested on the following configuration:

- Packet capturing device (no display): `udoox86gm1` (Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS)
- Wireshark running on `alpha` (Windows 10 Pro)

## Step-by-step instructions

### Install `dumpcap` on the remote capturing device

ssh gmacario@udoox86gm1

```bash
sudo apt-get update \
  && sudo apt-get -y install tshark
```

#### List interfaces on the remote capturing device

ssh gmacario@udoox86gm1

```bash
dumpcap --list-interfaces
```

Result:

```text
gmacario@udoox86gm1:~$ dumpcap --list-interfaces
1. enp2s0
2. tailscale0
3. docker0
4. veth0228b18
5. any
6. lo (Loopback)
7. virbr0
8. wlp3s0
9. bluetooth0
10. bluetooth-monitor
11. nflog
12. nfqueue
13. dbus-system
14. dbus-session
gmacario@udoox86gm1:~$
```

Make sure that interface `bluetooth-monitor` is listed. If not, verify that the `bluez` package is correctly installed and at least one `hcixx` interface is listed as a result of the `hciconfig -a` command.

### Launch Wireshark

Launch Wireshark on your local machine.

#### Capturing from `bluetooth-monitor` on remote device

Wireshark: Capture > Options...

Select "SSH remote capture" > Settings

- Tab "Server"
  - Remote SSH server address: `udoox86gm1`
  - Remote SSH server port: 22
- Tab "Authentication"
  - Remote SSH server username: (none)
  - Remote SSH server password: (none)
  - Path to SSH private key: (none)
  - SSH key passphrase: (none)
  - ProxyCommand: (none)
- Tab "Capture"
  - Remote interface: `bluetooth-monitor`
  - Remote capture command: dumpcap
  - Use sudo on the remote machine: (unchecked)
  - No promiscuous mode: (unchecked)
  - Remote capture filter: (empty)
  - Packets to capture: 0
- Tap "Debug"
  - Set the log level: Message
  - Use a file for debug: (empty)
- Save parameter(s) on capture start: Yes

then click "Save".

Wireshark: Capture > Start

The display on Wireshark gets updated as soon as HCI packets are captured from the remote device.

You may than execute the usual Wireshark commands, such as apply Display Filters, save the packet trace in a `*.pcapng` file, etc.

#### Example: Troubleshoot BLE connections

Execute `bluetoothctl` on the remote capture device:

```text
gmaca@alpha MINGW64 ~
$ ssh gmacario@udoox86gm1 bluetoothctl
[bluetooth]#
Agent registered
[CHG] Controller 30:E3:7A:65:25:FB Pairable: yes
[bluetooth]#
```

then type the following commands (replace `$PERIPHERAL_BT_ADDR` with the one of the peripheral you want to try connecting):

```text
scan on
connect $PERIPHERAL_BT_ADDR

# Wait about 1 minute, then if the connection is still on
disconnect
```

Apply the following Display Filter on Wireshark to focus on the commands and events involved in the connection and disconnection:

```text
(bthci_cmd.opcode == 0x0005) || \
(bthci_cmd.opcode == 0x0405) || \
(bthci_cmd.opcode == 0x0406) || \
(bthci_cmd.opcode == 0x200d) || \
(bthci_cmd.opcode == 0x2043) || \
(bthci_evt.code == 0x03) || \
(bthci_evt.code == 0x05) || \
(bthci_evt.code == 0x0f && \
    ((bthci_evt.opcode == 0x0405) || \
    (bthci_evt.opcode == 0x0406) || \
    (bthci_evt.opcode == 0x200d) || \
    (bthci_evt.opcode == 0x2043)) || \\
(bthci_evt.code == 0x3e && bthci_evt.le_meta_subevent == 0x0a)
```

Result:
