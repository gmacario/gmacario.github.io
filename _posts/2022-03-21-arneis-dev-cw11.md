Welcome to our weekly status report of the [ARNEIS project](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS)!

As [I announced in a previous post](https://gmacario.github.io/posts/2021-12-18-arneis-spatial-ai-finalist)

> Your team “B-AROL-O Bottling Systems” and project “ARNEIS: Automated Recognizer, Network-Enabled, Items Sorter” have been selected as one of just 50 teams to move on to Phase 2 of OpenCV Spatial AI Contest.
> Your team name and region are listed on the official webpage at <https://opencv.org/opencv-spatial-ai-contest/​>

Here is the report of our progress in the ARNEIS project after the end of CW11-2022.

## What did we accomplish this week?

In Sprint dev-cw11 we [closed 15 issues or Pull Requests](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3Adev-cw11).

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot of <https://github.com/orgs/B-AROL-O/projects/1/views/5> -->

Let's now dig into some of the major results we achieved during last week.

### B-AROL-O team at OpenCV Weekly Webinar

On Monday, 2022-03-13 we got an email from Phil Nelson informing us that due to technical issues the [OpenCV AI Game Show](https://opencv.org/gameshow/)
which was supposed to be kicked off on Episode 49 of the [OpenCV Weekly Webinar](https://twitter.com/opencvweekly) had to be postponed to the week after,
and proposing to fill in the empty slot and present [ARNEIS](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS) instead.

After some internal discussion with Alessandro and Gianluca we accepted the challenge.
Unfortunately we had only two days left for preparing the presentation, therefore we had to cut corners and speed up our plan to fill the 1h slot of the webinar.

Moreover, due to work priorities [Alessandro](https://github.com/alv67) would not be able to attend in person, therefore we decided that I ([Gianpaolo](https://github.com/gmacario)) would introduce the [B-AROL-O Team](https://github.com/B-AROL-O) and the [ARNEIS project](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS) in the first part of the webinar

<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/video/event/urn:li:ugcPost:6909587011267891201/">![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75182/159136335-12c6b155-d7be-4172-bf84-1a45ef91c181.png)</a>

... then would leave the stage to [Gianluca](https://github.com/gteti) who would talk about the mechanical design and zoom into the CV algorithm and the current issues we are still trying to solve.

We hope that the people who eventually attended the webinar on Thursday, 2022-03-17 were not disappointed.
As a matter of fact, by reading the comments in the [recorded video](https://www.linkedin.com/video/event/urn:li:ugcPost:6909587011267891201/) (LinkedIn login required) it looks like our project was well welcomed.

According to [The Zoom recording](https://twitter.com/opencvweekly/status/1504487889630945281) we had more than 100 people online up to the end.

Among the attendees we recognized a few friends and former colleagues; however, we were particularly amazed by having so many people from all over the world who joined the event and made very interesting questions and suggestions.

We are very thankful to [Satya](https://twitter.com/LearnOpenCV) and [Phil](https://twitter.com/philnelson) who invited us to the [OpenCV Weekly Webinar](https://twitter.com/opencvweekly), and we are looking forward to hearing more from the community.

Hopefully we will be able to meet some of you in person during one of next events in the coming weeks where we will be showcasing ARNEIS - more specifically:

* Saturday, 2022-04-09 and Sunday, 2022-04-10: [San Mauro Brick Show 2022](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/issues/130)
* Saturday, 2022-05-28 and Sunday, 2022-05-29: [Expo Mattoncino 6 Pinerolo](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/issues/213)

Please mark both events on your calendar and - if you happen to be around Torino during those days - don't forget to come and meet us!


### Built a second ARNEIS MOC

We managed to get our hands on another [LEGO&reg; 42100 Set](https://arneis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lego-set-42100/README.html) which we have used to verify the MOC design which Alessandro [released last weeek](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/tree/main/mocs/project#arneis-conveyor-v20220312).

After about 5h of work the MOC is complete

![2022-03-20-2141-moc-complete](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75182/159185341-6ee084a1-ad6d-4eee-b0bd-ce83908fc87d.jpg)

... and there are still A LOT of extra parts that we could use to improve the design!
