Welcome to our weekly status report of the [ARNEIS project](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS)!

As [I announced on 2021-12-18](https://gmacario.github.io/posts/2021-12-18-arneis-spatial-ai-finalist)

> Your team “B-AROL-O Bottling Systems” and project “ARNEIS: Automated Recognizer, Network-Enabled, Items Sorter” have been selected as one of just 50 teams to move on to Phase 2 of OpenCV Spatial AI Contest.
> Your team name and region are listed on the official webpage at <https://opencv.org/opencv-spatial-ai-contest/>

Here is the report of our progress in the ARNEIS project after the end of CW13-2022.

## What did we accomplish this week?

In Sprint dev-cw13 we [closed 13 issues or Pull Requests](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3Adev-cw13).

Let's now dig into some of the major results we achieved during last week.

### ARNEIS final report submitted to the OpenCV Spatial AI Contest

It was a long and bumpy journey, but we eventually made it!

I express my warm thank to my friends [Alessandro](https://github.com/alv67) and [Gianluca](https://github.com/gteti) who walked with me in this journey, and apologize all for the harsh comments I made on some [Issues](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/issues) or [Pull Requests](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/pulls).

Luckily for me GitHub - contrarily to other Social Media such as [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gpmacario) - allows authors to edit their comments afterwards, so as soon as I happen to read something which I wrote but does not reflect my actual thought and may be mis-interpreted, I will reserve the right to change it :-)

### ARNEIS OpenCV submission video

As part of the submission [Alessandro](https://github.com/alv67) has released a 3-minute video which [IMHO](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/05/there-is-only-one-thing-imho-can-mean/559481/) well summarizes the road from when we submitted the proposal until today.

Just click on the image to watch the video, or scan the QR Code to know more:

### Preparing for San Mauro Bricks 2022

Our journey with the OpenCV Spatial AI Contest is now over, but we do not rest on our laurels.

Our next milestone will happen on next week-end, when we will be showcasing ARNEIS at a very important event for [LEGO&reg;](https://www.lego.com/) [AFOLs](https://www.facebook.com/AFOL-Adult-Fan-Of-Lego--373554809322775/).

If you happen to be around Torino on Saturday 9th or Sunday 10th, please mark your calendar and consider dropping by and saying hello to us.
Please check <https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/issues/130> for details.

## Next week plans

As you can see from the [ARNEIS project backlog](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/issues), even though we submitted the final report to the [OpenCV Spatial AI Contest](https://opencv.org/opencv-spatial-ai-contest/), ARNEIS is not finished - and we are not going to stop caring and improving it.

That being said, we have so many ideas and so little time, so we encourage again your contribution.
We have already many ideas for improvement - and we thank all the people who suggested us possible roads we did not think in advance.

At the moment our plan for next week is public documented on GitHub: <https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/milestone/13>.

However - as I said on 2022-03-17 and I keep saying - ARNEIS is a fully Open Source Project, so you have the power to decide how and how fast the project will evolve!
