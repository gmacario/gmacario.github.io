Welcome to our weekly status report of the [ARNEIS project](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS)!

As [I announced in a previous post](https://gmacario.github.io/posts/2021-12-18-arneis-spatial-ai-finalist)

> Your team “B-AROL-O Bottling Systems” and project “ARNEIS: Automated Recognizer, Network-Enabled, Items Sorter” have been selected as one of just 50 teams to move on to Phase 2 of OpenCV Spatial AI Contest.
> Your team name and region are listed on the official webpage at <https://opencv.org/opencv-spatial-ai-contest/​>

Here is the report of our progress in the ARNEIS project after the end of CW02-2022.

## What did we accomplish this week?

Well, a lot!

Here is a partial list of the closed Issues and merged Pull Requests which we completed during this week.

Apologies for the unreadable screenshot -- Unfortunately I had not found a better way for exporting those items from GitHub and include them in this report in a suitable and more readable way.

For this reason I created [a dedicated issue for figuring that out](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/issues/32):

Suggestions and contributions from the readers are more than welcome!

Although this will not directly impact our achievements for Phase 2 of the OpenCV Spatial AI contest, we really want to streamline our weekly reports in order to be very transparent in our progress, highlight our pain points and possibly get feedbacks and suggestions from our community.

While waiting for some suggestions on how - for instance - create a GANNT diagram from GitHub - if you want to drill down on any specific open or closed issues, just [look at our GitHub repository](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS).

### Welcome to our first contributors

And speaking about external contributions...

First of all we want to express our gratitude to [Pietro d'Agostino](https://github.com/pitdagosti) for contributing his proposal for the [B-AROL-O team](https://github.com/B-AROL-O) logo!

<a href="https://github.com/B-AROL-O">![B-AROL-O logo](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/94399304?s=200&v=4)</a>

This is good starting point, and there is also room for someone else to [propose a logo for the ARNEIS project](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/issues/35) as well :wink:

We also thank [Rafael Esposito]() who was the first person not part of the B-AROL-O team to spot a bug in ARNEIS:

Of course the bug was promptly fixed since it wasn't that hard :wink;

Anyway this is part of a commitment we have made: to hear and be promptly reactive to Bug reports and Feature requests.

So, let't help each other and [submit both on GitHub](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/issues/new/choose)!
