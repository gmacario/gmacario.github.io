Welcome to our weekly status report of the [ARNEIS project](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS)!

As [I announced in a previous post](https://gmacario.github.io/posts/2021-12-18-arneis-spatial-ai-finalist)

> Your team “B-AROL-O Bottling Systems” and project “ARNEIS: Automated Recognizer, Network-Enabled, Items Sorter” have been selected as one of just 50 teams to move on to Phase 2 of OpenCV Spatial AI Contest.
> Your team name and region are listed on the official webpage at <https://opencv.org/opencv-spatial-ai-contest/​>

Here is the report of our progress in the ARNEIS project after the end of CW02-2022.

## What did we accomplish this week?

Well, a lot!

Here is a partial list of tasks which we completed during this week.

Unfortunately I could not figure out a better way for exporting the closed Issues and merged Pull Requests from GitHub to be included in this report.

For this reason I added [a dedicated issue for that](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/issues/32)

Suggestions and contributions from the readers are more than welcome!

We are trying to streamline our weekly reporting tool in order to provide as much transparency as possible on our progress, address our pain points and possibly get feedbacks and suggestions from our community.

### Welcome to our first contributors

First of all we express our gratitude to [Pietro d'Agostino](https://github.com/pitdagosti) for contributing the [B-AROL-O team](https://github.com/B-AROL-O) logo!

We also thank [Rafael Esposito]() who was the first person not part of the B-AROL-O team to spot a bug in ARNEIS:

Of course the bug was promptly fixed since it wasn't that hard :wink;

Anyway this is part of a commitment we have made: to hear and be promptly reactive to Bug reports and Feature requests.

So, let't help each other and [submit both on GitHub](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/issues/new/choose)!
