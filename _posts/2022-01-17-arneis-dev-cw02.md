Welcome to our weekly status report of the [ARNEIS project](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS)!

As I announced [in a previous post](https://gmacario.github.io/posts/2021-12-18-arneis-spatial-ai-finalist)

> Your team “B-AROL-O Bottling Systems” and project “ARNEIS: Automated Recognizer, Network-Enabled, Items Sorter” have been selected as one of just 50 teams to move on to Phase 2 of OpenCV Spatial AI Contest.
> Your team name and region are listed on the official webpage at <https://opencv.org/opencv-spatial-ai-contest/​>

Here is the report of our progress in the ARNEIS project after the end of CW02-2022.

## What did we accomplish this week?

Well, a lot!

Here is a partial list (closed Issues and merged Pull Requests) of what accomplished during this week:

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot of <https://github.com/orgs/B-AROL-O/projects/1/views/5> -->

Apologies for the unreadable screenshot - unfortunately I couldn't find a better way for exporting those items from GitHub and include them here in a more suitable way.

For this reason I created [a dedicated issue for figuring that out](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/issues/32):

Suggestions and contributions from the readers are more than welcome!

Although this will not directly impact our achievements for Phase 2 of the OpenCV Spatial AI contest, we really want to streamline our weekly reports in order to be very transparent in our progress, highlight our pain points and possibly get feedbacks and suggestions from our community.

### Welcome to our first contributors

And speaking about external contributions...

First of all we want to express our gratitude to [Pietro d'Agostino](https://github.com/pitdagosti) for contributing his proposal for the [B-AROL-O team](https://github.com/B-AROL-O) logo!

<a href="https://github.com/B-AROL-O">![B-AROL-O logo](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/94399304?s=200&v=4)</a>

This is good starting point, but all the software projects it can always be improved!

Also, this a challenge for anyone else (even [@pitdagosti](https://github.com/pitdagosti) again...) to [propose a logo for the ARNEIS project](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/issues/35) as well ;-)

Kudos also to [Rafael Esposito](https://github.com/Raffone17) who was the first person outside of the B-AROL-O core team to spot a bug in ARNEIS:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75182/149654634-fa9aab4d-ef80-4528-a5d0-fadd364d800c.png)

Of course the bug was promptly fixed since it wasn't that hard :wink;

Anyway this is part of a commitment we have made: to hear and be promptly reactive to Bug reports and Feature requests.

So, let't help each other and [submit both on GitHub](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/issues/new/choose)!

## Next week plans

First of all a disclaimer:

<a href="https://www.pinterest.it/pin/104638391317411342/">![If the plan doesn't work](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/2d/cb/3f/2dcb3f8f17e82d18f487a9e333d0bb64.jpg)</a>

That being said, here is our plan for CW03-2022:

<!-- 
TODO: Add screenshot of <https://github.com/orgs/B-AROL-O/projects/1/views/1>
-->

While waiting for some suggestions on how to - for instance - create a [Gantt chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_chart) from GitHub data, if you want to drill down on any specific open or closed issues, just [look at our GitHub repository](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS).

Also, if you are interested to track what we've been doing please click on the "Watch" button at the top right of <https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS>

Talk to you next week!
