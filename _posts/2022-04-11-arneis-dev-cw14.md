Welcome to our weekly status report of the [ARNEIS project](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS)!

As [I announced in a previous post](https://gmacario.github.io/posts/2021-12-18-arneis-spatial-ai-finalist)

> Your team “B-AROL-O Bottling Systems” and project “ARNEIS: Automated Recognizer, Network-Enabled, Items Sorter” have been selected as one of just 50 teams to move on to Phase 2 of OpenCV Spatial AI Contest.
> Your team name and region are listed on the official webpage at <https://opencv.org/opencv-spatial-ai-contest/>

Here is the report of our progress in the ARNEIS project after the end of CW14-2022.

## What did we accomplish this week?

In Sprint dev-cw14 we [closed 15 issues or Pull Requests](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3Adev-cw14).

Let's now dig into some of the major results we achieved during last week.

### Meeting in Arduino with Massimo Banzi

On Friday, 2022-04-08 [Alessandro](https://github.com/alv67) and myself made a visit to [Arduino offices in Torino](https://blog.arduino.cc/2012/02/22/welcome-officine-arduino-torino/), hosted inside [Toolbox Coworking](https://www.toolboxcoworking.com/).

![Arduino](https://uca363cc77df9a20b8ac7a053de7.previews.dropboxusercontent.com/p/thumb/ABjmUTeAO3sUCvkQSWvcNl8SgpXOOXp3pUbJpJIQF8Vk5iPovFD0o5IQIifjx68mSEXsBZkmPZLOtVYGe6zuoQRqE4dDzsq0NjIRPal_4VDqqoGwbpl8ohjs2H__ExkjzE848KF5GXKuMCmOKfMVl9wiu4cA_5V0ae_V9rM8J_W5oBoTwYZk2phWt-eHRPkqWzqJJhWlP1sRq6VG4pG4wCWfHdq9R2hDEzPHuh6jB4WHP3tc4GfXlmxLEkxpdSH2GBMmgHGCHhpvxrB6Dg1PgoznGqqiTJf7-SF888vbb3uxqFLHbTzYJLjhdHQBf5zPZYGa2NsuCGAoWVGfyTdW5VO8bKgSXDJJaGoMfg9EC6wJAkiNqJc6RgRfP1SkSLWgqEFWVavYswqdeempCrf7adKXU7jjYqQVsMJDIXlJCXsYSA/p.jpeg)

During our visit we had the privilege to meet [Massimo Banzi](https://massimobanzi.com/about/), one of the founders of this iconic company and the spirit behind the openess and the innovation of the Makers movement all around the world.

We are really grateful to [Achille Montanaro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/achille-montanaro) who juggled with Massimo Banzi hectic agenda and managed to carve out half an hour of his precious time to talk to us!

Massimo Banzi is a real ispiration to us; what he and the other co-founders managed to achieve since 2005 when [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) (the company) was founded and released all their hardware and software designs under an Open Source license gave us the motivation to apply the same pattern with ARNEIS!

### ARNEIS project is getting known

Thanks to word-of-mouth the ARNEIS project has started to be known outside the OpenCV community where it originated.

It is always amazing to receive messages from friends, neighbours or colleagues who casually discover <https://arneis.readthedocs.io> and come back to us to ask questions, provide feedbacks or simply complimenting us!

As usual, even a constructive criticism is important to us, so please don't be shy, and if you happen to have a login on GitHub please create Issues or submit Pull Requests! If you do not and you do not want to login to GitHub (but we advise you to), ask someone who can ;-)

### San Mauro Brick Show 2022

As [previously announced](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/issues/130) we spent the week-end from 2022-04-09 to 2022-04-10 in San Mauro Torinese, where we had been invited by [Piemonte Bricks LUG](https://www.piemontebricks.it/) to showcase the ARNEIS project.

As a matter of fact, even though it is only at its third edition, [San Mauro Brick Show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RE2Iz95NlAw) is already one of the most important event for [LEGO&reg; AFOLs](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/AFOL) in Italy, and being there and being able to present the ARNEIS project is yet another recognition we have received and which we have proud of!

Here is the trunk of my car filled with all the pieces to bring to the show
