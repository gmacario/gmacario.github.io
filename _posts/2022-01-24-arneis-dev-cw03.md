Welcome to our weekly status report of the [ARNEIS project](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS)!

As [I announced in a previous post](https://gmacario.github.io/posts/2021-12-18-arneis-spatial-ai-finalist)

> Your team “B-AROL-O Bottling Systems” and project “ARNEIS: Automated Recognizer, Network-Enabled, Items Sorter” have been selected as one of just 50 teams to move on to Phase 2 of OpenCV Spatial AI Contest.
> Your team name and region are listed on the official webpage at <https://opencv.org/opencv-spatial-ai-contest/​>

Here is the report of our progress in the ARNEIS project after the end of CW03-2022.
