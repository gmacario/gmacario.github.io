Welcome to our weekly status report of the [ARNEIS project](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS)!
-->

As [I announced in a previous post](https://gmacario.github.io/posts/2021-12-18-arneis-spatial-ai-finalist)

> Your team “B-AROL-O Bottling Systems” and project “ARNEIS: Automated Recognizer, Network-Enabled, Items Sorter” have been selected as one of just 50 teams to move on to Phase 2 of OpenCV Spatial AI Contest.
> Your team name and region are listed on the official webpage at <https://opencv.org/opencv-spatial-ai-contest/​>

Here is the report of our progress in the ARNEIS project after the end of CW03-2022.

## What did we accomplish this week?

In Sprint dev-cw03 we [closed 24 issues or Pull Requests](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/milestone/2?closed=1)

Let's highlight the most significant ones.

### Enhancements to the B-AROL-O logo

[Pietro d'Agostino](https://github.com/pitdagosti), the author of the first non-core team member contribution [which we spoke about last week](https://gmacario.github.io/posts/2022-01-17-arneis-dev-cw02), did not rest on his laurels and implemented the suggestions he received in [[FEAT]: Enhancements to B-AROL-O logo B-AROL-O/ARNEIS#35](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/issues/35).

The updated B-AROL-O logo is now proudly featured on our [GitHub](https://github.com/B-AROL-O) and [Twitter profiles](https://twitter.com/baroloteam)!

### arneis.readthedocs.io

GitHub is good and fine for developers, but we would like to have a simple and more user-friendly for end users.

Taking inspiration by <https://docs.luxonis.com/> we learned how to leverage the [Sphinx project](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) and [ReadTheDocs.org](https://readthedocs.org/) to generate a static website for the ARNEIS project.

The result is the following one

<a href="https://arneis.readthedocs.io">![arneis.readthedocs.io](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75182/150799340-326048b7-332a-4d85-bacb-3431501f8ae3.png)</a>

The site <https://arneis.readthedocs.io> is still a little bit rough, but thanks to ReadTheDocs we have already introduced a couple of additional features that are not available on the GitHub.

One of those feature I found most useful is the full text search

Additionally, you may export the contents of the site in PDF, HTML or Epub!

### Keep getting familiar with OAK-D-Lite

* We are trying to see if we can use 2 different OAK-D-LITE and we opened an issue to the maintainers [[FEAT]: Investigate the feasibility to use 2 OAK-D-Lites at the same time B-AROL-O/ARNEIS#54](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/issues/54)
-->

### But wait, there is more

As this post is getting long we have no time to talk about some other things which made into the dev-cw03 release. They will likely be the subjects of one of our next posts.

However, if you are impatient and want a heads-up, just have a look at

* [B-AROL-O/ARNEIS#58](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/pull/58)
* [B-AROL-O/ARNEIS#83](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/pull/83)

## Next week plans

Our plan for next week is available on GitHub: <https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/milestone/3>.
