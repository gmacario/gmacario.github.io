Let's now dig into some of the major results we achieved during last week.

### Talks with Piemonte Bricks LUG

Over the last weekend we attended the event "[In un mondo di Bricks](https://facebook.com/events/s/in-un-mondo-di-bricks/2779705722333200/)" organized by [Piemonte Bricks LUG](https://lan.lego.com/clubs/354-piemonte-bricks-lug/) (short for [_LEGO&reg; User Group_](https://arneis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/acronyms.html)) nearby our offices.

Piemonte Bricks is one of the biggest LUGs in Italy which gathers several AFOLs (short for [_Adults Fanatic of LEGO&reg;_](https://arneis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/acronyms.html)) from Piedmont and has officially been acknowledged by the LEGO&reg; Group&trade;.

The exhibition showcased a few official LEGO&reg; sets (there was even one [Liebherr R 9800](https://arneis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lego-set-42100)!)

as well as some MOCs (acronym for [_My Own Creation_](https://arneis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/acronyms.html)) designed by the LUG members.

I also had a chance of talking with some of the LUG members, including [Silvia Grillo](https://www.facebook.com/silvia.grillo.10) (the [LEGO&reg; Ambassador](https://lan.lego.com/)) and [Lorenzo Brovia](https://www.facebook.com/ilbrovia) to whom I pitched the ARNEIS project and showed them the concept we have been working on.

Silvia was really excited about the project and enthusiastically proposed us to showcase ARNEIS in one of the next events organized by [Piemonte Bricks LUG](https://www.facebook.com/piemontebricksLUG/) - more specifically:

- [Villaggio Leumann in Bricks 2022](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/issues/208)
- [San Mauro Brick Show 2022](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/issues/130)

We are very proud of this invitation, but since the quality of the event we have been asked to participate is quite high we need to figure out some details first.
In any case I promised to get back to her in a few days - hopefully to confirm our participation to one of those events.
