Welcome to our weekly status report of the [ARNEIS project](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS)!
-->

As [I announced in a previous post](https://gmacario.github.io/posts/2021-12-18-arneis-spatial-ai-finalist)

> Your team “B-AROL-O Bottling Systems” and project “ARNEIS: Automated Recognizer, Network-Enabled, Items Sorter” have been selected as one of just 50 teams to move on to Phase 2 of OpenCV Spatial AI Contest.
> Your team name and region are listed on the official webpage at <https://opencv.org/opencv-spatial-ai-contest/​>

Here is the report of our progress in the ARNEIS project after the end of CW11-2022.

## What did we accomplish this week?

In Sprint dev-cw12 we [closed TODO issues or Pull Requests](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3Adev-cw12).

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot of <https://github.com/orgs/B-AROL-O/projects/1/views/5> -->

Let's now dig into some of the major results we achieved during last week.

### ARNEIS System Integration in progress

TODO

### Preparing the final submission to the OpenCV Spatial AI Contest

TODO

### Get inspiration from the Arduino Week

TODO

Arduino Week 2022 <https://week.arduino.cc/>.

There were a lot of inspiring sessions all over the week, including the interview to [Denis Ruffino](https://it.linkedin.com/in/denis-ruffino-26a6a110) (our manager) on Day 4 (2022-03-24).

TODO: Screenshot

... oops, I just realized I revealed a trade secret!

We have been repeatedly asked to disclose the name of the company where Alessandro, Gianluca and myself are employed, but we have always declined.
As I explained during [Episode 39 of the OpenCV Weekly Webinar](TODO), 
we decided to apply to the Spatial AI Contest and have been developing ARNEIS only as a hobby project and outside our working hours, with the only purpose of learning and having fun, and without any corporate support or sponsorship.

Now the secret is officially over, even though I know that some smart people had already figured it out by looking at the letters between the `B` and the `O` in our team name ;-)

Back to the Arduino Week, the day which personally inspired me most was in fact Day 6 (Saturday, 2022-03-26) 

[![ARDUINO WEEK 2022 Day 6](https://img.youtube.com/vi/AqgJ17d8UnQ/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqgJ17d8UnQ?t=0 "ARDUINO WEEK 2022 Day 6")


[Massimo Banzi](TODO) and his guests urged the audence to invest energy and efforts in learning, tweaking and possibly improving the world for the new generations.


[Arduino](TODO) has done this for the last 10 years, and I would dream of doing something similar -- by the way, this is why [ARNEIS artifacts are released under an Open Source license](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/blob/main/README.md#copyright-and-license).

If you have no time for watching the full recording (3h), at least please watch [this presentation](https://youtu.be/AqgJ17d8UnQ?t=7924)  (2:12:00):

I am pretty sure that after 6 minutes you will agree with me:
