Welcome to our weekly status report of the [ARNEIS project](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS)!
-->

As [I announced in a previous post](https://gmacario.github.io/posts/2021-12-18-arneis-spatial-ai-finalist)

> Your team “B-AROL-O Bottling Systems” and project “ARNEIS: Automated Recognizer, Network-Enabled, Items Sorter” have been selected as one of just 50 teams to move on to Phase 2 of OpenCV Spatial AI Contest.
> Your team name and region are listed on the official webpage at <https://opencv.org/opencv-spatial-ai-contest/​>

Here is the report of our progress in the ARNEIS project after the end of CW11-2022.

## What did we accomplish this week?

In Sprint dev-cw12 we [closed TODO issues or Pull Requests](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3Adev-cw12).

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot of <https://github.com/orgs/B-AROL-O/projects/1/views/5> -->

Let's now dig into some of the major results we achieved during last week.

### ARNEIS System Integration in progress

TODO

### Preparing the final submission to the OpenCV Spatial AI Contest

### Get inspiration from the Arduino Week

TODO

Arduino Week 2022 <https://week.arduino.cc/>.

There were a lot of inspiring sessions all over the week, including the interview to [Denis Ruffino](https://it.linkedin.com/in/denis-ruffino-26a6a110) (our manager) on Day 4 (2022-03-24).

... oops, I probably revealed a very well known secret!

We have been asked many times to reveal the name of the company where Alessandro, Gianluca and myself are employed, but we always declined.
As I explained during [Episode 39 of the OpenCV Weekly Webinar](TODO) that the decision to join the OpenCV Spatial AI Contest and develop ARNEIS came out of our personal interest and so far has been done exclusively as a hobby project and outside the working hours.

So now the secret is officially over, even though some smart people told me they figured it out by looking at the letters between the `B` and the `O` in our team name ;-)

Back to the Arduino Week, the day which personally inspired me most was in fact Day 6 (Saturday, 2022-03-26) where Massimo Banzi and the other guests to invest energy and efforts in learning, tweaking and possibly improving the world for the new generations.

If you have not had a chance of watching the live stream I would recommend to review the recording:

If three hours are too much, just jump here to [2:12:14](https://youtu.be/AqgJ17d8UnQ?t=7934)

## Next week plans
