Welcome to our weekly status report of the [ARNEIS project](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS)!
-->

As [I announced in a previous post](https://gmacario.github.io/posts/2022-04-25-arneis-dev-cw16)

> During the [OpenCV Weekly Webinar Ep. 54](https://twitter.com/opencvweekly/status/1517171312807989249) we learned that our team was selected as a Top 10 Finalist of the [OpenCV Spatial AI Contest](https://opencv.org/opencv-spatial-ai-contest/) sponsored by Intel and Microsoft.
>
> It is already a great honor to have gone so far, and especially sharing this achievement together with such outstanding teams!
>
> However, the competition is not yet over, since the committee announced that a special prize will be awarded to the team who will receive most votes in a [public poll on the internet](https://form.jotform.com/221086334784156).
