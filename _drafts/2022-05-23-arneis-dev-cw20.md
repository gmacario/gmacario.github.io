### The ARNEIS project hit release 1.0

We have officially released Rel. 1.0 of the ARNEIS project.
Please find it under <https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/releases>.

### Not attending Expo Mattoncino 6

We are sorry to let you know that due to personal engagements we will not be able to attend [Expo Mattoncino 6](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/issues/213).

Let's hope to have more chances for meeting in person during one of the future events, such as [San Giorgio Canavese Brick Expo 2022](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/issues/262).

## Next week plans

Our plan for next week is available on GitHub: <https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/milestone/20>.
