Welcome to our weekly status report of the [ARNEIS project](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS)!

As [I announced in a previous post](https://gmacario.github.io/posts/2021-12-18-arneis-spatial-ai-finalist)

> Your team “B-AROL-O Bottling Systems” and project “ARNEIS: Automated Recognizer, Network-Enabled, Items Sorter” have been selected as one of just 50 teams to move on to Phase 2 of OpenCV Spatial AI Contest.
> Your team name and region are listed on the official webpage at <https://opencv.org/opencv-spatial-ai-contest/>

Here is the report of our progress in the ARNEIS project after the end of CW16-2022.

## What did we accomplish this week?

In Sprint dev-cw16 we [closed TODO issues or Pull Requests](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3Adev-cw16).

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot of <https://github.com/orgs/B-AROL-O/projects/1/views/5> -->

Let's now dig into some of the major results we achieved during last week.

### ARNEIS Top 10 Finalist of the OpenCV Spatial AI Contest

During the [OpenCV Weekly Webinar Ep. 54](https://twitter.com/opencvweekly/status/1517171312807989249) we learned that our team was selected as a Top 10 Finalist of the [OpenCV Spatial AI Contest](https://opencv.org/opencv-spatial-ai-contest/) sponsored by Intel and Microsoft - click on the image to watch the full announcement:

It is already a great honor to have gone so far, and especially sharing this achievement together with such outstanding teams!

However, the competition is not yet over, since the committee announced that a special prize will be awarded to the team who will receive most votes in a [public poll on the internet](https://form.jotform.com/221086334784156).

This is why we are now making a public call to all our friends and supporters:

**PLEASE VOTE AND MAKE YOUR FRIENDS VOTE FOR "Team B-AROL-O - ARNEIS" [ON THIS SITE](https://form.jotform.com/221086334784156)!**

### Preparing for ARNEIS Release 1.0

Work is ongoing for Release 1.0 of the ARNEIS project.
For this reason we are prioritizing bugfixes over new features.

Among the many bugfixes we have closed, [Alessandro](https://github.com/alv67) managed to restore the possibility to download the PDF with all the contents of <https://arneis.readthedocs.io>. 

The complete PDF (as of today 193 pages, for about 45 MB) can be downloaded by simply clicking the corresponding link on the bottom left of the site:
