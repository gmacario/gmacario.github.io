Welcome to our weekly status report of the [ARNEIS project](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS)!
-->

As [I announced in a previous post](https://gmacario.github.io/posts/2021-12-18-arneis-spatial-ai-finalist)

> Your team “B-AROL-O Bottling Systems” and project “ARNEIS: Automated Recognizer, Network-Enabled, Items Sorter” have been selected as one of just 50 teams to move on to Phase 2 of OpenCV Spatial AI Contest.
> Your team name and region are listed on the official webpage at <https://opencv.org/opencv-spatial-ai-contest/>

Here is the report of our progress in the ARNEIS project after the end of CW13-2022.

## What did we accomplish this week?

In Sprint dev-cw13 we [closed 13 issues or Pull Requests](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3Adev-cw13).

Let's now dig into some of the major results we achieved during last week.

### ARNEIS submitted to the OpenCV Spatial AI Contest

It was a long and bumpy journey, but we made it!

### ARNEIS OpenCV submission video

As part of the submission [Alessandro](https://github.com/alv67) has released a 3-minute video which [IMHO](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/05/there-is-only-one-thing-imho-can-mean/559481/) well summarizes the road from when we submitted the proposal until today.

Just click on the image to watch the video, or scan the QR Code to know more:

### Preparing for San Mauro Bricks 2022

Our journey to the OpenCV Spatial AI Contest is now over, but we do not rest on our laurels.

Our next milestone is on next week-end where we will be showcasing ARNEIS at a very important event for LEGO AFOLs

Please see <https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/issues/130> for details and - if you happen to be around Torino - mark your calendar and consider dropping by and saying hello to us.



## Next week plans

Our plan for next week is available on GitHub: <https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/milestone/13>.

As you can see from the [ARNEIS project backlog](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/issues) we have already many ideas for improvement - and we sincerely thank all the people who suggested us possible roads we did not think in advance.
However we have so many ideas and so little time, so we encourage again your contribution.

As we said on 2022-03-17 and we like saying, ARNEIS is a fully Open Source Project, so how the project will evolve and improve does not only depend on us!
