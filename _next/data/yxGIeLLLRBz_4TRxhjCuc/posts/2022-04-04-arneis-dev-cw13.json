contrarily to other Social Media such as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gpmacario\">Twitter</a> - allows authors to edit their comments afterwards, so as soon as I happen to read something which I wrote but does not reflect my actual thought and may be mis-interpreted, I will reserve the right to change it :-)</p>\n<h3 id=\"arneis-opencv-submission-video\">ARNEIS OpenCV submission video</h3>\n<p>As part of the submission <a href=\"https://github.com/alv67\">Alessandro</a> has released a 3-minute video which <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/05/there-is-only-one-thing-imho-can-mean/559481/\">IMHO</a> well summarizes the road from when we submitted the proposal until today.</p>\n<p>Just click on the image to watch the video, or scan the QR Code to know more:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHFRRHWtTqY\" title=\"ARNEIS submission Video draft -

and we are not going to stop caring and improving it.</p>\n<p>That being said, we have so many ideas and so little time, so we encourage again your contribution.\nWe have already many ideas for improvement - and we thank all the people who suggested us possible roads we did not think in advance.</p>\n<p>At the moment our plan for next week is public documented on GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/milestone/13\">https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/milestone/13</a>.</p>\n<p>However - as I said on 2022-03-17 and I keep saying - ARNEIS is a fully Open Source Project, so you have the power to decide how and how fast the project will evolve!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwAOgkqVJMo\" title=\"Using AI &amp; LEGO to Recognize, Sort, and Package Bottles -
