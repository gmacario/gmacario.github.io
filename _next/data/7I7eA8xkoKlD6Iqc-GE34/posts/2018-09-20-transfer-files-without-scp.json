{"pageProps":{"post":{"title":"Transferring files to an embedded target without scp","content":"<p>If you have a tiny embedded system which does not include the <code>scp</code> tool, you may use the <code>nc</code> tool and achieve the same results.</p>\n<p>The only prerequisite is that host and target are connected via IP networking.</p>\n<p>Notice that nc is implemented as part of BusyBox, so there is a high chance that this tool is available inside your embedded target filesystem.</p>\n<h3 id=\"example-copy-a-tarball-from-the-host-to-the-target\">Example: Copy a tarball from the host to the target</h3>\n<p>In this example, let us create a tarball with the <code>/etc</code> directory of the host and transfer it to the target:</p>\n<pre><code>root@target:~# ifconfig\nroot@target:~# nc -l -p 4000 &gt;myfile.tar.gz\n</code></pre>\n<p>You may choose to listen to any available TCP port (I picked 4000 at random). You need to be root to listen to a privileged port (below 1024).</p>\n<p>Assuming that the IP address of the target was 192.168.12.35, the following command executed on the host will create a tarball with the contents of the <code>/etc</code> directory and transfer it to the target:</p>\n<pre><code>user@host:~$ tar cvz /etc | nc 192.168.12.35 4000\n</code></pre>\n<p>You may verify the integrity of the transferred file with the following command</p>\n<pre><code>root@target:~# tar -xvzf myfile.tar.gz\n</code></pre>\n<p>Of course you may do many more things, just do <code>man nc</code> (on the host) to learn how!</p>\n<!-- EOF -->\n"},"config":{"title":"gmacario.github.io","description":"Gianpaolo Macario's public rants","social":{"github":{"name":"gmacario","link":"https://github.com/gmacario"},"twitter":{"name":"gpmacario","link":"https://www.twitter.com/gpmacario"}}}},"__N_SSG":true}
