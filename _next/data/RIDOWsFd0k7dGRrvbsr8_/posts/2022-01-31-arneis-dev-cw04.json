one of which even offered a 41% discount on its list price.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75182/151664835-0c4a324f-47dd-4285-bd4a-5c68c04a4677.png\" alt=\"image\"></p>\n<p>Later we were communicated that the requested sets should be purchased and delivered to us directly by the OpenCV Spatial AI Contest organization, threfore we could not get the 41% rebate on the chosen set.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately a couple of days ago <a href=\"https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/issues/7#issuecomment-1024859461\">Phil Nelson from OpenCV wrote us</a> that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I’ve been trying to track this down online for awhile, it appears the Liebherr R 9800 Excavator set is retired by LEGO.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is bad news, since we have based all our design and planning of the ARNEIS project under the assumption that we would receive this LEGO Set ASAP.</p>\n<p>As of today it looks like there are still a few items left from a couple of vendors on Amazon.it:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75182/151653389-54f26295-4f85-4b64-ae85-6ae13c8fa875.png\" alt=\"image\"></p>\n<p>and eBay.it</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75182/151653398-edc00489-11db-48fe-b62e-06042d6fed98.png\" alt=\"image\"></p>\n<p>but their prices are increasing - most likely because the set is no longer produced - so we need to hurry up.</p>\n<p>By the way, at the moment we are not aware of alternate LEGO sets containing so many useful pieces for our design, such as motors, controllers, gears, etc.</p>\n<p>Let&#39;s hope we can quickly sort this issue out together with Phil and the OpenCV organization.</p>\n<h2 id=\"next-week-plans\">Next week plans</h2>\n<p>Our plan for next week is available on GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/milestone/3\">https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/milestone/3</a>.</p>\n<!-- TODO: Add screenshot of <https://github.com/orgs/B-AROL-O/projects/1/views/1> -->\n\n<p>If you want to help or just say hello, please get in touch with us through <a href=\"https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS\">GitHub</a> or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/baroloteam\">Twitter</a>.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading up to here!</p>\n<p>Gianpaolo on behalf of the <a href=\"https://github.com/b-arol-o\">B-AROL-O Team</a>.</p>\n<!-- EOF -->\n"},"config":{"title":"gmacario.github.io","description":"Gianpaolo Macario's public rants","social":{"github":{"name":"gmacario","link":"https://github.com/gmacario"},"twitter":{"name":"gpmacario","link":"https://www.twitter.com/gpmacario"}}}},"__N_SSG":true}
