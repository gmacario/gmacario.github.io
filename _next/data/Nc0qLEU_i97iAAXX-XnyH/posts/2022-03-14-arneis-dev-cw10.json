The main idea is to use a chain where some kind of <em>pushers</em> are used to move bottles over a flat surface.</p>\n<p>The chain is not used as a base surface for the bottles due to the difficulty of ensuring that it will stay horizontal during the movement.</p>\n<p>A special support is designed to hold the <a href=\"https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/hardware/en/latest/pages/DM9095.html\">OAK-D-Lite</a> AI Camera used in this project. It is possible to change the tilt of the camera by using the dedicated linear extender arm.</p>\n<p>The white wall acts as a background for taking better snapshots of the bottles during their trip on the conveyor.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/raw/main/mocs/project/arneis-conveyor-20220312.gif\" alt=\"arneis-conveyor-20220312.gif\"></p>\n<p>Please look at <a href=\"https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/tree/main/mocs/project\">https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/tree/main/mocs/project</a> for details.</p>\n<h3 id=\"progress-in-controlling-the-lego-powered-up-devices\">Progress in controlling the LEGO&reg; Powered Up devices</h3>\n<p>Under the <code>/code</code> folder of the <a href=\"https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS\">ARNEIS repository on GitHub</a> I have uploaded  <code>poweredupapp-flash-move</code>.
