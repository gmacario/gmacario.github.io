however, we were particularly amazed by having so many people from all over the world who joined the event and made very interesting questions and suggestions.</p>\n<p>We are very thankful to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LearnOpenCV\">Satya</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/philnelson\">Phil</a> who invited us to the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/opencvweekly\">OpenCV Weekly Webinar</a>, and we are looking forward to hearing more from the community.</p>\n<p>Hopefully we will be able to meet some of you in person during one of next events in the coming weeks where we will be showcasing ARNEIS - more specifically:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Saturday, 2022-04-09 and Sunday, 2022-04-10: <a href=\"https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/issues/130\">San Mauro Brick Show 2022</a></li>\n<li>Saturday, 2022-05-28 and Sunday, 2022-05-29: <a href=\"https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/issues/213\">Expo Mattoncino 6 Pinerolo</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please mark both events on your calendar and - if you happen to be around Torino during those days - don&#39;t forget to come and meet us!</p>\n<h3 id=\"working-on-a-synthetic-dataset-for-training-the-arneis-nn\">Working on a synthetic dataset for training the ARNEIS NN</h3>\n<p>As explained by Satya during the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/opencvweekly/status/1504487889630945281\">2022-03-17 OpenCV AI Webinar</a>, the most effective way improving the recognition rate of the Neural Network is to provide a comprehensive dataset for training.</p>\n<p>At the moment we have been using about 500 real pictures taken with the OAK-D-Lite to a subset of the &quot;mignon&quot; bottles we have available. </p>\n<p>During the webinar Satya suggested to enhance the dataset for training by developing 3D models of each bottle, slapping hi-res scans of the labels, then use programs such as Unity or Roboflow to generate plenty of syntetic pictures with different orientation, lighting and obstactles in order to reinforce the training algorithm of the Neural Network.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=z9g3WNcAAAAJ&amp;hl=ro\">Stefan Daniel Achirei</a> commented in the chat</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>toolkit for generating synthetic data:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.perception\">https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.perception</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This toolkit was presented in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGGtF_4v5sQ\">Episode 43 of the OpenCV Weekly Webinar</a> a few weeks ago (skip to 45:28 of the video recording):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGGtF_4v5sQ\" title=\"What&#39;s New With the OpenCV AI Kit Plugin for Unity w/ Gerard Espona - Weekly Ep #43 - 02/03/22\"><img src=\"https://img.youtube.com/vi/LGGtF_4v5sQ/0.jpg\" alt=\"What&#39;s New With the OpenCV AI Kit Plugin for Unity w/ Gerard Espona - Weekly Ep #43 - 02/03/22\"></a></p>\n<p>Please subscribe to <a href=\"https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/issues/258\">ARNEIS#258</a> if you are interested in the process or can provide further suggestions or feedbacks.</p>\n<h3 id=\"built-a-second-arneis-moc\">Built a second ARNEIS MOC</h3>\n<p>We managed to get our hands on another <a href=\"https://arneis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lego-set-42100/README.html\">LEGO&reg;
