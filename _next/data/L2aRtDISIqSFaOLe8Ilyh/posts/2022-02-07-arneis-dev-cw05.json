purists no 3D printing parts or modified bricks are required.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/main/docs/images/oak-d-lite-lego-support-04.jpg\" alt=\"oak-d-lite-lego-support-01.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Another remarkable feature of this design is that it leaves the dissipation surface of the OAK-D-Lite uncovered; this should minimize overheating the OAK-D-Lite when the camera is in use.</p>\n<p>You may find more details, including the complete <a href=\"https://stud.io/\">Studio 2.0</a> CAD model, at <a href=\"https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/blob/main/mocs/studies/camera-support\">https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/blob/main/mocs/studies/camera-support</a>.</p>\n<p>This design - like all the other deliverables of the ARNEIS project - is released under the MIT license.\nWe encourage everybody - including the other <a href=\"https://opencv.org/opencv-spatial-ai-contest/\">OpenCV Spatial AI Contest finalists</a>, to use and possible improve it.\nIf so, feel free to submit a <a href=\"https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/pulls\">Pull Request on ARNEIS project on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"motorized-bottle-conveyor-2022-02-06\">Motorized Bottle Conveyor (2022-02-06)</h3>\n<p>Alessandro also published an evolution of the conveyor idea that <a href=\"https://gmacario.github.io/posts/2022-01-31-arneis-dev-cw04\">was presented last week</a>.\nNow a motor and relative gearing is applied to the driving sprocket wheel.</p>\n<p>All the parts used in this design are available in the LEGO&reg;

This may prove helpful for both the training phase of the ARNEIS Neural Network, as well as at runtime to deploy the web application, store the results, etc.\n\nFor this reason we have bootstrapped a tiny [Lightweight Kubernetes cluster](https://k3s.io/) and documented the process [in this HOWTO](https://arneis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howto/howto-install-k3s-for-arneis.html). We hope this document may be helpful and inspiring for other future projects as well!\n-->\n\n<h2 id=\"next-week-plans\">Next week plans</h2>\n<p>Our plan for next week is available on GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/milestone/12\">https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/milestone/12</a>.</p>\n<!-- TODO: Add screenshot of <https://github.com/orgs/B-AROL-O/projects/1/views/1> -->\n\n<p>Unfortunately we will not be able to progress much further with the mechanical design <a href=\"https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/issues/7\">until we get the actual LEGO set</a>.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, we are going to train the ARNEIS Neural Network using photos taken with the OAK-D-Lite to our set of &quot;mignon&quot; bottles:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75182/146777189-d154dd14-2f70-4097-a950-b17159fdaaf7.jpg\" alt=\"Some mignon bottles\"></p>\n<p>In parallel we would like to evaluate <a href=\"https://roboflow.com/\">Roboflow</a> which - based on the information we collected so far - should simplify and speed up the training process a lot.\nIf you have first-hand experience on Roboflow, please report your success stories and/or lessons learned on <a href=\"https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/issues/123\">https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/issues/123</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thats-all-folks\">That&#39;s all, folks</h2>\n<p>Thanks for reading up to the end of such long post!</p>\n<p>If you want to help with the ARNEIS project or just say hello to us, please get in touch with us through GitHub at <a href=\"https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS\">https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS</a> or Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/baroloteam\">https://twitter.com/baroloteam</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/gmacario\">Gianpaolo</a> on behalf of the <a href=\"https://github.com/B-AROL-O\">B-AROL-O Team</a>.</p>\n<!-- EOF -->\n"},"config":{"title":"gmacario.github.io","description":"Gianpaolo Macario's public rants","social":{"github":{"name":"gmacario","link":"https://github.com/gmacario"},"twitter":{"name":"gpmacario","link":"https://www.twitter.com/gpmacario"}}}},"__N_SSG":true}
