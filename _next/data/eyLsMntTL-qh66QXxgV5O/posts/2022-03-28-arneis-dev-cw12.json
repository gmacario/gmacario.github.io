This composite share of knowledge helps making impossible things possible, and will contribute to improving the world for the new generations.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.arduino.cc\">Arduino</a> has been doing this for the last 10 years, and I would dream of being able to do something similar -- by the way, this is why <a href=\"https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/blob/main/README.md#copyright-and-license\">ARNEIS artifacts are released under an Open Source license</a>.</p>\n<p>If you have no time for watching the full recording (3h), at least please watch <a href=\"https://youtu.be/AqgJ17d8UnQ?t=7924\">this presentation</a>  (2:12:00):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqgJ17d8UnQ?t=7920\" title=\"ARDUINO WEEK 2022 Day 6\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75182/160293521-1faf47b2-1b99-4cdb-80ad-ee8f5b8ad321.png\" alt=\"ARDUINO WEEK 2022 Day 6\"></a></p>\n<p>I am pretty sure that after 6 minutes you will agree with me:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/gpmacario/status/1508124989928706048\"><img src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FO3vmxnWYAA2xLM?format=jpg&name=large\" alt=\"2022-03-27-arduino-day6-good-job-guys.png\"></a></p>\n<h3 id=\"arneis-system-integration-in-progress\">ARNEIS System Integration in progress</h3>\n<p>We are in code freeze process as we approach release 0.1.0 - a.k.a. the first public release of the ARNEIS project.</p>\n<p>Here is a picture of the system integration bench of the ARNEIS project.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/raw/280-feat-arneis-system-integration-for-the-release/docs/images/2022-03-26-1855-arneis-sysint.jpg\" alt=\"2022-03-26-1855-arneis-sysint.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Details in the draft Pull Request: <a href=\"https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/pull/281\">https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/pull/281</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"preparing-the-final-submission-to-the-opencv-spatial-ai-contest\">Preparing the final submission to the OpenCV Spatial AI Contest</h3>\n<p>As we approach to the deadline for the final submission to the OpenCV Spatial AI Context, our team is busy preparing the final report as well as a short video that the selection committee will use to evaluate the project and rank it among the 50 finalists.</p>\n<p>The prizes for the three best projects are - to use an understatement as we are used here in Piedmont - &quot;interesting&quot;:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75182/160473643-0c71fa5a-154a-4d02-9b58-44168ed17482.png\" alt=\"image\"></p>\n<p>(Source: <a href=\"https://opencv.org/opencv-spatial-ai-contest/\">https://opencv.org/opencv-spatial-ai-contest/</a>)</p>\n<p>The prizes are of course a big motivator, but even more important is for us to be able to convey the message that - thanks to the community and help from each other - in a short amount of time as we had it is possible to produce significant results in terms of experience but also fun.</p>\n<p>We hope we will soon be able to share the final video.
