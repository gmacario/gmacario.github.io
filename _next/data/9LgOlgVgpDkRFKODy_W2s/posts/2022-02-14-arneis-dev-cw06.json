This may prove helpful for both the training phase of the ARNEIS Neural Network, as well as at runtime to deploy the web application, store the results, etc.\n\nFor this reason we have bootstrapped a tiny [Lightweight Kubernetes cluster](https://k3s.io/) and documented the process [in this HOWTO](https://arneis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howto/howto-install-k3s-for-arneis.html). We hope this document may be helpful and inspiring for other future projects as well!\n-->\n\n<h2 id=\"next-week-plans\">Next week plans</h2>\n<p>Our plan for next week is available on GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/milestone/5\">https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/milestone/5</a>.</p>\n<!-- TODO: Add screenshot of <https://github.com/orgs/B-AROL-O/projects/1/views/1> -->\n\n<h2 id=\"thats-all-folks\">That&#39;s all, folks</h2>\n<p>Thanks for reading up to the end of such long post!</p>\n<!-- Thanks for reading up to here! -->\n\n<p>If you want to help or just say hello, please get in touch with us through <a href=\"https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS\">GitHub</a> or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/baroloteam\">Twitter</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/gmacario\">Gianpaolo</a> on behalf of the <a href=\"https://github.com/B-AROL-O\">B-AROL-O Team</a>.</p>\n<!-- EOF -->\n"},"config":{"title":"gmacario.github.io","description":"Gianpaolo Macario's public rants","social":{"github":{"name":"gmacario","link":"https://github.com/gmacario"},"twitter":{"name":"gpmacario","link":"https://www.twitter.com/gpmacario"}}}},"__N_SSG":true}
