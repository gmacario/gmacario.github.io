if you have any suggestions, please follow-up on <a href=\"https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/issues/7\">ARNEIS/issues/7</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"first-attempts-at-recognizing-mignon-bottles-with-the-oak-d-lite\">First attempts at recognizing mignon bottles with the OAK-D-Lite</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/gteti\">Gianluca Teti</a> - the wannabe AI expert in our team - has been playing with the OAK-D-Lite software for the purpose of recognizing the mignon bottles that will be handled by the ARNEIS system.</p>\n<p>He already got some results:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51110452/150135037-d63e327e-09fe-4384-9d58-36086fb443a6.png\" alt=\"image\"></p>\n<p>The actual photo shoot took place using this stage:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51110452/150135084-27eeea29-5450-42bc-a5f2-266a1dfeb47e.jpeg\" alt=\"photo1642596731\"></p>\n<p>Here are some more details about the stage:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51110452/150135077-a100064d-f18e-419f-a48c-9eea85da4a76.jpeg\" alt=\"photo1642596718\"></p>\n<p>In the coming days we will be optimizing the lighting and will update the camera setup to match the actual layout of the ARNEIS conveyor. You may see some preliminary studies <a href=\"https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/issues/89\">here</a>.\nAs soon as we finalize the layout, we will be start training a customized Neural Network to recognize the bottle types we will be classifying.</p>\n<h2 id=\"next-week-plans\">Next week plans</h2>\n<p>Our plan for next week is available on GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/milestone/3\">https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/milestone/3</a>.</p>\n<!-- TODO: Add screenshot of <https://github.com/orgs/B-AROL-O/projects/1/views/1> -->\n\n<p>If you want to help or just say hello, please get in touch with us through <a href=\"https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS\">GitHub</a> or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/baroloteam\">Twitter</a>.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading up to here!</p>\n<p>Gianpaolo on behalf of the <a href=\"https://github.com/b-arol-o\">B-AROL-O Team</a>.</p>\n<!-- EOF -->\n"},"config":{"title":"gmacario.github.io","description":"Gianpaolo Macario's public rants","social":{"github":{"name":"gmacario","link":"https://github.com/gmacario"},"twitter":{"name":"gpmacario","link":"https://www.twitter.com/gpmacario"}}}},"__N_SSG":true}
