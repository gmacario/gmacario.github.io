This may prove helpful for both the training phase of the ARNEIS Neural Network, as well as at runtime to deploy the web application, store the results, etc.</p>\n<p>For this reason we have bootstrapped a tiny <a href=\"https://k3s.io/\">Lightweight Kubernetes cluster</a> and documented the process <a href=\"https://arneis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howto/howto-install-k3s-for-arneis.html\">in this HOWTO</a>. We hope this document may be helpful and inspiring for other future projects as well!</p>\n<h2 id=\"next-week-plans\">Next week plans</h2>\n<p>Our plan for next week is available on GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/milestone/12\">https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS/milestone/12</a>.</p>\n<!-- TODO: Add screenshot of <https://github.com/orgs/B-AROL-O/projects/1/views/1> -->\n\n<p>If you want to help or just say hello, please get in touch with us through GitHub at <a href=\"https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS\">https://github.com/B-AROL-O/ARNEIS</a> or Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/baroloteam\">https://twitter.com/baroloteam</a>.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading up to here!</p>\n<p>Gianpaolo on behalf of the <a href=\"https://github.com/b-arol-o\">B-AROL-O Team</a>.</p>\n<!-- EOF -->\n"},"config":{"title":"gmacario.github.io","description":"Gianpaolo Macario's public rants","social":{"github":{"name":"gmacario","link":"https://github.com/gmacario"},"twitter":{"name":"gpmacario","link":"https://www.twitter.com/gpmacario"}}}},"__N_SSG":true}
